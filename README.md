# connect4
This app is a python implementation of the classic connect4 game. In this program you play against a computer. To win you need to place 4 tokens to form a line of 4 (download the official rules [here](https://instructions.hasbro.com/api/download/A5640_en-us_Connect-4-Game.pdf)).

## Install and use

To install this app you can follow the following steps:

1. Clone repository on your local machine

    `git clone https://github.com/ftagliaca/connect4 `

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional)

   This project uses python 3.10, you can create a virtual environment using venv, virtualenv, or anaconda (not recommended).

   `virtualenv -p python3.10 venv`

3. Install the required packages

    Required packages are listed in `requirements.txt`

    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. Run the app

    Run the app with the following command:

    `python3 app.py`

It is that simple!

## Technologies used

This app is built using numpy and pygame. Numpy is used to store the board information and do quick checks on the status of the board. This mainly allows to check for a winner quickly, without having to implement nested loops in python, which could be very slow. Pygame is used to display the GUI of the app.

The following technologies are also used to make sure the code is good:
- flake8:

  `flake8` is used to lint the code

- pep8-naming

  `pep-naming` makes sure all the variables, functions, classes, etc. are named following the standard python naming conventions.

- mypy

  `mypy` is used to do type checking on the python files. This is mostly used for functions where a specific input or output is expected.

- pre-commit

  `pre-commit` is used to make sure all files commited to github are formatted correctly. Many different checks are performed depending on the file type. The pre-commit [config file](.pre-commit-config.yaml) contains all the hooks used in the pre-commit.

- pytest

  Tests are written using python's `unitest` module. The tests are then run using pytest. These tests are run both locally and automatically using Github actions whenever a new commit is merged onto main.

- codecov

  Uses the coverage report generated by pytest to show the percentage of your code tested, along with which lines of your code have not been tested. This action is automatically executed using github actions and https://codecov.io

## Known issues

No known issues, but it is the unknown unknowns that are the difficult ones.

## Planned updates

The AI now places token in a random column where a spot is available. This makes winning against the AI very easy. A future version could check if you (the human player) are close to a win (have 3 tokens in a row) and try to stop you. Otherwise it will pick a random spot. Adding another layer of difficulty could consist in favoring moves next to an already placed token. Finally, as connect four is a [solved game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solved_game), the outcome can be predicted from any move, meaning that the AI could pick a move where it has the highest likelihood of winning.

 A difficulty selection screen could be added to select between these difficulties.
